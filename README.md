# Data Integration and Predictive Modeling for Heart Failure: A Data Science Approach ü©∫‚ù§Ô∏è

This project focuses on integrating and optimizing clinical data from hospitals to develop a predictive model for heart failure, using a data science approach in the hospital environment. The work involves data acquisition, preprocessing, and building machine learning models, followed by the deployment of a dashboard and a web application for predictions.

The original project was developed in Spanish but there is a copy of the report in English.

## Features
- **Data Integration**: ETL processes to clean, transform, and integrate data from different sources (hospital data, patient data, heart failure datasets).
- **Machine Learning Models**: Comparison and implementation of several models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees) for binary classification.
- **Predictive Model**: A final Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was selected after hyperparameter tuning, achieving optimal performance for heart failure prediction.
- **Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard provides visual insights into the dataset, allowing professionals to access key information and statistics related to hospitals and patients.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly web interface for healthcare professionals to input patient data and receive instant heart failure predictions.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: For data processing, modeling, and API integration.
- **R**: For web scraping and data extraction from hospital databases.
- **Power BI**: For dashboard creation and data visualization.
- **SQL Server**: Theoretical usage for data warehousing.
- **Jupyter Notebook & RStudio**: For model development and analysis.
- **Spoon**: Used for ETL processes.
